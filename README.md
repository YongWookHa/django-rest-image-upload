# django-rest-image-upload

This repository provide REST-API based image transaction. It generates unique API-Key for users and validate the authority. Django frameworks provides good rest api packages and simple admin page. So you can focus on writing core processes.

I wrote this django codes for deploying services which processes images. 
For example, you can deploy your OCR service with this django app.
I added base64 decoding feature because I prefer image transfer with json format.

I hope this would be helpful.
